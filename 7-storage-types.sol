There are 3 storage types in solidity :
    1. Storage  : 
        -   variables declared in contract outside functions
            are called state variables and are stored in Storage.
        -   Data in the storage are written in the blockchain ,
            are available between function calls and transactions.
        -   storage data is expensive


    2. Memory   :
        -   Temporary storage
        -   Declared inside the functions, also function args are of memory storage
        -   After function execution, memory varibales are cleared 
        -   Cheaper than memory 



    3. Call data/Stack  :
        -   Temporary storage , declared inside functions
        -   Call data can't be modified inside function
        -   Mosty call data is used with external functions
        -   Cheaper than memory
